        <div class="rfour">

          <p class="rone"><em>"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"</em> is a song by new wave band Talking Heads, released in November 1983 as the second single from their fifth album Speaking in Tongues. The lyrics were written by David Byrne,
            and the music was written by Byrne and the other members of the band, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry   <br> Harrison.</p>
          <p class="rone">In the "Self Interview" on the DVD of the concert film Stop Making Sense, Byrne states that it is a love song, a topic he tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He also said of the song:</p>
          <blockquote id="rtwo">That's a love song made up almost completely of non sequiturs, phrases that may have a strong emotional resonance but don't have any narrative qualities. It's a real honest kind of love song. I don't think I've ever
            done a real love song before. Mine always had a sort of reservation, or a twist. I tried to write one that wasn't corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do. I think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that.

          Pick me up and turn me round<br>
          I feel numb, born with a weak heart<br>
          I guess I must be having fun<br>
          The less we say about it, the better<br>
          Make it up as we go along<br>
          Feet on the ground, head in the sky<br>
          It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing</p>

          I'm just an animal looking for a home<br>
          Share the same space for a minute or two<br>
          And you love me 'til my heart stops<br>
          Love me 'til I'm dead<br>
